This repository contains the C++ code for the controller. It is provided as an open-source code for the researchers who are interested in the Multi-contatc scenarios.
Here, I give a tutorial on how one can start simulations properly. Please do no hesitate to contact me or share your opinion in case of any issues or difficulties in running the controller.
