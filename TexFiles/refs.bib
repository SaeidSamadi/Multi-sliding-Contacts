@article{Sardain2004,
abstract = {In the area of biped robot research, much progress has been made in the past few years. However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences {\&} Mathematics as well as the organization's Award for Engineering {\&} Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook's team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.},

@article{Caron2017TRO,
abstract = {We propose a method for checking and enforcing multicontact stability based on the zero-Tilting moment point (ZMP). The key to our development is the generalization of ZMP support areas to take into account: 1) frictional constraints and 2) multiple noncoplanar contacts. We introduce and investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full support area. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots by using the linear pendulum mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors. We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call the pendular support area. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular support area is a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible multicontact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging multicontact scenarios.},

The target robot is a 42 DOF humanoid robot HRP-4C which has a body dimensions close to the average Japanese female. We develop a body posture controller and foot force controllers on the joint position servo of the robot. By applying this posture/force control, we can regard the robot system as a simple linear inverted pendulum with ZMP delay. After a preliminary experiment to confirm the linear dynamics, we design a tracking controller for walking stabilization. It is evaluated in the experiments of HRP-4C walking and turning on a lab floor. The robot can also perform an outdoor walk on an uneven pavement.},

abstract = {We consider dynamic stair climbing with the HRP-4 humanoid robot as part of an Airbus manufacturing use-case demonstrator. We share experimental knowledge gathered so as to achieve this task, which HRP-4 had never been challenged to before. In particular, we extend walking stabilization based on linear inverted pendulum tracking [1] by quadratic programming-based wrench distribution and a whole-body admittance controller that applies both end-effector and CoM strategies. While existing stabilizers tend to use either one or the other, our experience suggests that the combination of these two approaches improves tracking performance. We demonstrate this solution in an on-site experiment where HRP-4 climbs an industrial staircase with 18.5 cm high steps, and release our walking controller as open source software.11https://github.com/stephane-caron/lipm-walking-controller/},

abstract = {This paper focuses on a stabilization control for multi-contact motion which enables a humanoid robot to locomote by realizing dynamic contact transitions on non-flat environment. In the stabilization process of the multi-contact motion, the desired Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) is modified by the position of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) error with respect to the 3D Center of Mass (CoM) motion generated from the force distribution ratio. The contact wrench of each end-effector is determined by quadratic optimization considering the centroidal dynamics and contact friction constraints so as to satisfy the modified ZMP. Each end-effector is controlled by optimized force reference through a projection of null space by force distribution ratio. We propose a multi-contact stabilization framework which can be designed not only to generate 3D CoM motion but also the CoM position estimation and the optimal force distribution around the reference ZMP in a unified manner from a balance controller, by using the force distribution ratio. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by a quadruped locomotion leaning against a vertical wall using the joint position controlled humanoid HRP-5P in a dynamic simulator.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a fast computation method for 3D multi-contact locomotion. The contributions of this paper are (a) the derivation of the prospect centroidal dynamics by introducing a force distribution ratio, where the centroidal dynamics in multi-contact can be represented with a formulation similar to the inverted pendulum's one, and (b) the development of a fast computation method for generating a 3D center of mass (CoM) trajectory. The proposed method allows to generate a trajectory sequentially and to change the locomotion parameters at any time even under variable CoM height. Then, the contact timing of each end-effector can be adjusted to synchronize with the actual contact with the environment by shortening or extending the desired duration of the support phase. This can be used to improve the robustness of the locomotion. In this paper, we deal with a multi-contact locomotion which can be fully received a vertical reaction force from the environment and the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by several numerical results: the CoM motion while changing the contact timing and a multi-contact locomotion considering a transition between biped and quadruped walking in a dynamics simulator.},

In such an environment, the physical constraints with a collision avoidance, joint limitations and support region on the terrain, become dominant limitations for an exploration. Updating environmental information to biped walking pattern generator and c~ntroller, a biped walking on a complicated rough terrain can be achieved.

By defining the generalized zero-moment point (GZMP), we obtain the region of it for keeping the balance of the robot during manipulation.

The region of the GZMP is obtained by considering the infinitesimal displacement and the moment about the edges of the convex hull.
