abstract = {In the area of biped robot research, much progress has been made in the past few years. However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences {\&} Mathematics as well as the organization's Award for Engineering {\&} Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook's team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.},

abstract = {We propose a method for checking and enforcing multicontact stability based on the zero-Tilting moment point (ZMP). The key to our development is the generalization of ZMP support areas to take into account: 1) frictional constraints and 2) multiple noncoplanar contacts. We introduce and investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the full support area. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots by using the linear pendulum mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the LPM induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal floors. We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call the pendular support area. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the pendular support area is a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate feasible multicontact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging multicontact scenarios.},

While existing stabilizers tend to use either one or the other, our experience suggests that the combination of these two approaches improves tracking performance.

abstract = {This paper focuses on a stabilization control for multi-contact motion which enables a humanoid robot to locomote by realizing dynamic contact transitions on non-flat environment. In the stabilization process of the multi-contact motion, the desired Zero-Moment Point (ZMP) is modified by the position of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) error with respect to the 3D Center of Mass (CoM) motion generated from the force distribution ratio. The contact wrench of each end-effector is determined by quadratic optimization considering the centroidal dynamics and contact friction constraints so as to satisfy the modified ZMP. Each end-effector is controlled by optimized force reference through a projection of null space by force distribution ratio. We propose a multi-contact stabilization framework which can be designed not only to generate 3D CoM motion but also the CoM position estimation and the optimal force distribution around the reference ZMP in a unified manner from a balance controller, by using the force distribution ratio. The effectiveness of proposed method is validated by a quadruped locomotion leaning against a vertical wall using the joint position controlled humanoid HRP-5P in a dynamic simulator.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a fast computation method for 3D multi-contact locomotion. The contributions of this paper are (a) the derivation of the prospect centroidal dynamics by introducing a force distribution ratio, where the centroidal dynamics in multi-contact can be represented with a formulation similar to the inverted pendulum's one, and (b) the development of a fast computation method for generating a 3D center of mass (CoM) trajectory. The proposed method allows to generate a trajectory sequentially and to change the locomotion parameters at any time even under variable CoM height. Then, the contact timing of each end-effector can be adjusted to synchronize with the actual contact with the environment by shortening or extending the desired duration of the support phase. This can be used to improve the robustness of the locomotion. In this paper, we deal with a multi-contact locomotion which can be fully received a vertical reaction force from the environment and the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by several numerical results: the CoM motion while changing the contact timing and a multi-contact locomotion considering a transition between biped and quadruped walking in a dynamics simulator.},

abstract = {This paper presents the meta-algorithmic approach used to realize multi-contact walking on the humanoid robot, DURUS. This sys- tematic methodology begins by decomposing human walking into a se- quence of distinct events (e.g. heel-strike, toe-strike, and toe push-off). These events are converted into an alternating sequence of domains and guards, resulting in a hybrid system model of the locomotion. Through the use of a direct collocation based optimization framework, a walk- ing gait is generated for the hybrid system model emulating human-like multi-contact walking behaviors – additional constraints are iteratively added and shaped from experimental evaluation to reflect the machine's practical limitations. The synthesized gait is analyzed directly on hard- ware wherein feedback regulators are introduced which stabilize the walk- ing gait, e.g., modulating foot placement. The end result is an energy- optimized walking gait that is physically implementable on hardware. The novelty of this work lies in the creation of a systematic approach for developing dynamic walking gaits on 3D humanoid robots: from for- mulating the hybrid system model to gait optimization to experimental validation refined to produce multi-contact 3D walking in experiment.},

The key idea of our method is approximating the feasibility of an arm contact as its sustainability during a bipedal walking cycle, which we call 'geometrical feasibility'. First, we plan a global path by RB-RRT with the reachability model and discretize it using footstep planning. In order to find sustainable contacts, we compute the intersections between the reachability volumes and environments along the planned footsteps, which are defined as contactable areas, and define contact candidates inside these intersections. Then, we prioritize possible contact sets based on their contactable areas and expected supportability. We pass these contact sets to whole-body motion planning process according to their priorities, and evaluate static equilibrium and kinematic constraints to generate quasi-static contact transitions. We apply the proposed system to four different simulation experiments, and conclude that it is a reasonable solution for the difficulty in predicting 'feasible' arm contacts, which contributes to improving multi-contact capability of locomotion planning for a humanoid robot.},

This paper proposes a conceptually simple framework of human posture control based on optimization which takes into account grasp and friction and achieves robustness against external disturbances. A new stability criteria is also introduced. Contrary to most other approaches, our method deals not only with unilateral contacts with friction but also with bilateral grasps. This allows for arbitrarily pulling, pushing or twisting on a handhold.

abstract = {This work presents an extension of balance control for torque-controlled humanoid robots. Within a non-strict task hierarchy, the controller allows the robot to use the feet end-effectors to balance, while the remaining hand end-effectors can be used to perform Dual-Arm manipulation. The controller generates a passive and compliance behaviour to regulate the location of the centre of mass (CoM), the orientation of the hip and the poses of each end-effector assigned to the task of interaction (in this case bi-manipulation). Then, an appropriate wrench (force and torque) is applied to each of the end-effectors employed for the task to achieve this purpose. Now, in this new controller, the essential requirement focuses on the fact that the desired wrench in the CoM is computed through the sum of the balancing and bi-manipulation wrenches. The bi-manipulation wrenches are obtained through a new dynamic model that allows executing tasks of approaching the grip and manipulation of large objects compliantly. On the other hand, the feedback controller has been maintained but in combination with a bi-manipulation-oriented feedforward control to improve the performance in the object trajectory tracking. This controller is tested in different experiments with the robot TORO.},
